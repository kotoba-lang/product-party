  "Portable product ↔ party (company/supplier/merchant) join graph.

  This library is the **operator-facing join contract** between trade items
  and legal/operating parties for kotoba-lang + cloud-itonami. It deliberately
  does NOT own product identity or company master data:

    - Product identity SSoT  → etzhayyim GTIN actor / uchiwake product graph
    - Listed-company SSoT    → etzhayyim kabuto (`org.corp.*`)
    - Commodity classification → etzhayyim `20-actors/unspsc` (8-digit codes)
    - Segment blueprints     → kotoba-lang/unspsc (2-digit segments)
    - Industry blueprints    → kotoba-lang/industry (ISIC classes)

  What this lib owns is the **edge**: which party plays which role on which
  product, with UNSPSC/ISIC tags for procurement and open-business routing.

  Edge vocabulary mirrors uchiwake's brand-owner / supplier / carrier /
  operator links and kabuto's `org.corp.*` id space, so operator tenants can
  project those graphs without re-implementing them.

  Pure data + pure functions. No network, no governor, no store backend.
  cloud-itonami wraps this with a tenant MemStore + bind/revoke effects."
